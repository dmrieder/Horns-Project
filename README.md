=============

Developing this project with sculptor Dana Raymond, Lee Cherry, and Fernanda Duarte. Fernanda and I are responsible for the Arduino-based programming and connectivity with both GPS receivers and 6-12v power sources for the horns. The project is a digital interactive sculpture that turns on/off eight horns based on gps-tracked movements in an urban space.
